Training Graphs

DynamicGraph = [graph1, graph2, graph3,..., graphN]
    
    graph -> node1, node2, weight

DynamicGraph -> Directory
DynamicGraph[graphi,graphi+1,...,graphN] -> graphi.txt, graphi+1.txt,..., graphN.txt,


Code Greedy Algorithm for Dynamic Influence Maximization.
Code Dynamic Independent Cascade Model for calculating Influence Spread in Greedy Algorithm.

Run Greedy Algorithm on the data and generate this file.
influence_label.csv -> graphi, seed set, influence

Now Code a GNN Model that trains on this data and provide this influence_label.csv for supervised training.

Now The Greedy Algorithm should calculate the influence spread through the GNN output.
